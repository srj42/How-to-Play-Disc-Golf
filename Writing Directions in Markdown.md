# How To Play Disc Golf

## What is Disc Golf
Disc golf is a sport in which players throw concave plastic discs into a series of metal baskets. It is usually played on an outdoor course with 18 unique holes using primarily the same rules as golf. To start playing a round of disc golf, you will only need a few discs and a course to play on.

## Objective
Complete the course in the fewest possible throws.

## Caution
When walking anywhere on a disc golf course, always keep your head on a swivel and watch out for flying discs. As a courtesy towards others, if you throw or see a disc being thrown in someone's general direction, make sure to yell "fore" to warn them that a disc is flying towards them and prevent injury.

## Types of Discs
Disc golf discs, are not meant to be used interchangeably. Instead, each disc is designed to behave a specific way and can generally be placed into one of four different categories.
### Putters
* Putters are best for floating in the air and catching the chains. 
### Midrange
* Midrange discs sort of fall in between and offer more distance than putters, while utilizing more control than drivers.
### Fairway Drivers
* Fairway drivers used for straighter shots that midranges can't get to. Discs designed for control, not max distance.
### Distance Drivers
* Distance drivers are meant for longer distances and for moving from one side to the other in flight.

## Steps
### 1. Selecting a disc for the Tee Shot
* Take a look at the sign next to the teepad to find the par and distance to the basket.
* If the baseket is further than 300 feet, then choose a fairway driver or distance driver.
* If the basket is less than 300 feet away, consider selecting a midrange disc.

### 2. Throwing the Tee Shot
* The Tee Shot is taken from the teepad, which is a large rectangular slab of concrete, brick, or turf, that you will throw from at the start of the hole.
* Take your disc and walk to the back of the teepad.
* Use your throwing hand to grab your disc so that your thumb is on the top and your other fingers are touching the inside rim of the disc.
* Turn 90 degrees so that your throwing arm is facing your target.
* Starting with your back foot, take three steps towards the basket.
* Take one more step towards the basket while simultaneously reaching your throwing across your chest and away from the basket.
* Quickly pull your throwing arm across your chest towards the basket and let go of the disc.

### 3. Watching the Disc
* After you throw, it is important to know where the disc lands, as that is where you will take your next shot.
* Keep an eye on the disc after you throw, especially if there is tall grass, thick brush, or water around the course.

### 4. Finding the Disc
* After the disc lands, walk towards its location.
* If you find the disc, move on to step 5.
* If you can not find your disc, add one penalty throw to your score and take your next shot from the spot where you lost the disc.

### 5. Approaching the Basket
* When approaching the basket you should be about 100 - 300 feet away from the basket. 
* A midrange disc would be most appropriate for this type of shot.
* Use your throwing hand to grab your disc so that your thumb is on the top and your other fingers are touching the inside rim of the disc.
* Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and turn 90 degrees so your throwing arm is facing the basket.
* Reach your throwing arm across your chest away from the basket.
* Quickly pull your throwing arm across your chest towards the basket and let go of the disc.
* Repeat step 5 until you are within 50 feet of the basket.

### 6. Puuting
* Putting in disc golf is usually done in close proximity to the basket.
* This kind of shot is best done with a putter.
* Use your throwing hand to grab your disc so that your thumb is on the top and your other fingers are touching the inside rim of the disc.
* Stand facing the basket with the foot on your throwing side in front of the other.
* Hold the disc flat and bring it in towards your chest by bending your elbow and wrist.
* Quickly extend your elbow, flick your wrist, and release the disk to spin it towards the basket.
* Repeat step 6 until the disc hits the chains and lands in the basket.

* Repeat steps 1-7 until you finish the course.
