# How To Play Disc Golf

## What is Disc Golf
Disc golf is a sport in which players throw concave plastic discs into a series of metal baskets. It is usually played on an outdoor course with 18 unique holes using primarily the same rules as golf. To start playing a round of disc golf, you will only need a few discs and a course to play on.

## Objective
Complete the course in the fewest possible throws.

## Caution
When walking anywhere on a disc golf course, always keep your head on a swivel and watch out for flying discs. As a courtesy towards others, if you throw or see a disc being thrown in someone's general direction, make sure to yell "fore" to warn them that a disc is flying towards them and prevent injury.

## Types of Discs
Disc golf discs, are not meant to be used interchangeably. Instead, each disc is designed to behave a specific way and can generally be placed into one of four different categories.
### Putters
* Putters are best for floating in the air and catching the chains. 
### Midrange
* Midrange discs sort of fall in between and offer more distance than putters, while utilizing more control than drivers.
### Fairway Drivers
* Fairway drivers used for straighter shots that midranges can't get to. Discs designed for control, not max distance.
### Distance Drivers
* Distance drivers are meant for longer distances and for moving from one side to the other in flight.


## Steps
### 1. Selecting a disc for the Tee Shot
* Take a look at the sign next to the teepad to find the par and distance to the basket.
* If the baseket is further than 300 feet, then selecting a fairway driver or distance
