# How To Play Disc Golf

## What is Disc Golf
Disc golf is a sport in which players throw concave plastic discs into a series of metal baskets. It is usually played on an outdoor course with 18 unique holes using primarily the same rules as golf. To start playing a round of disc golf, you will only need a few discs and a course to play on.

## Objective
Complete the course in the fewest possible throws.

## Caution
When walking anywhere on a disc golf course, always keep your head on a swivel and watch out for flying discs. As a courtesy towards others, if you throw or see a disc being thrown in someone's general direction, make sure to yell "fore" to warn them that a disc is flying towards them and prevent injury.
